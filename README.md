## About me

### 🎨 Creative developer

With a background in both design as well as development, a good amount of experience working in multidisciplinary teams, and a passion for UX, I’m able to bridge the communication gap between designers and developers using interactive prototypes.

### 🌱 Always learning

I'm driven by a never ending passion to learn something new. This could be learning to work with a new design tool, or learning to develop a new tool myself. I'm always looking at upcoming trends, to work on relevant social topic, with the newest technologies.

## Favorite quote

> A computer terminal is not some clunky old television with a typewriter in front of it. It is an interface where the mind and body can connect with the universe and move bits of it about.
